::  link-proxy-hook: make local pages available to foreign ships
::
::    this is a "proxy" style hook, relaying foreign subscriptions into local
::    stores if permission conditions are met.
::    the patterns herein should one day be generalized into a proxy-hook lib.
::
::    this adopts a very primitive view of groups-store as containing only
::    groups of interesting (rather than uninteresting) ships. it sets the
::    permission condition to be that ship must be in group matching the path
::    it's subscribing to.
::    we check this on-watch, but also subscribe to groups so that we can kick
::    subscriptions if needed (eg ship removed from group).
::
::    we deduplicate incoming subscriptions on the same path, ensuring we have
::    exactly one local subscription per unique incoming subscription path.
::    this comes at the cost of assuming that the store's initial response is
::    whatever's returned by the scry at that path, but perhaps that should
::    become part of the stores standard anyway.
